Hi this is Hotscratcher. This is my first ever coding project. I vibe coded using Gemini Pro 2.5. I actually added Gemini API for the AI letter writing. I often create interactive cheat sheets for myself to help me acheive projects (like navigating receiving a notice to pay or quit). I'm getting into the habit of making them universal. Hope this helps! This is for educational purposes only. This is not legal advice. Always consult a legal professional when doing anything tenant related.
