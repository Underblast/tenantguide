Hi this is Hotscratcher. This is my first ever coding project. I vibe coded using Gemini. I actually added Gemini API for the AI letter writing. I'm currently going through this process myself, and figured I would lay a path so others may follow what I am doing for myself. I often create interactive cheat sheets for myself to help me acheive projects. I'm getting into the habit of making them universal. Hope this helps! This is for educational purposes.
